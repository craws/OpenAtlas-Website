# About

OpenAtlas website is the home page of the [OpenAtlas](https://openatlas.eu)
project which is an open source, web based database system for complex
archaeological, historical and geospatial data.

This is just the code for the project website which is rather basic.
If you are interested in a more complex Flask application you might want to take
a look at the OpenAtlas project on [GitHub](https://github.com/craws/OpenAtlas).
