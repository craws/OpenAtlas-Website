# About

OpenAtlas website is the home page of the [OpenAtlas](http://openatlas.eu) project which is an open source, web based database system for complex archaeological, historical and geospatial data.

This is just the code for the project website which is rather basic. If you are interested in the OpenAtlas application take a look at it on [GitHub](https://github.com/craws/OpenAtlas).

At the moment the (new) OpenAtlas project website is in the concept phase.
