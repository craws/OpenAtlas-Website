    <p>
        This is an overview of implemented features. For upcoming features take a look at our
        <a target="_blank" href="https://redmine.openatlas.eu/projects/uni/roadmap">Roadmap</a>.
    </p>
    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-4">CIDOC CRM</h4>
    <p>
        The web interface provides tools to enter and manipulate data which will be saved in a
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cidoc-crm.org/">CIDOC CRM</a>
        compatible model to a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>
        database. A main focus of OpenAtlas is to design a web
        interface that allows users not to focus on the the underlying data model but to enter data in a convenient and easy way. Therefore, the CIDOC CRM
        specification was imported into the system. It can be browsed and is used to verify link
        conformity between entities. Additionally, link combinations can be tested manually
        e.g when planning model extensions.
    </p>
    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-4">Interactive Map</h4>
    <p>
        Places with known location can be entered into an interactive map based on
        <a target="_blank" href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, which features different view
        layers, allows for zooming, fullscreen mode, clustering, searching and much more.
        <a target="_blank" href="https://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a> is used for creating and
        manipulating spatial data. Therefore, it is possible to enter location as needed as multiple points, lines, areas and shapes.
    </p>
    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-4">System, Custom and Value Types</h4>
    <p>
        Due to this feature, the model and user interface forms can be adapted for specific research
        interests. Already provided system types can be extended. Additionally, it is possible to
        add new types e.g. "hair color" for persons. These type hierarchies can be configured to
        allow single or multiple choices. A type can be used for multiple entities e.g.
        a hierarchy like "importance" for places, actors and groups.
        Furthermore, value types can be created to add numeric values e.g. weight or material composition
        of a find.
    </p>
    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-4">Linked data</h4>
    <p>
        Adding the possibility of linking data is an ongoing process. At the moment links to
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.geonames.org/">GeoNames</a> identifier can be created
        in the map using the GeoNames API. Also linking generic references, e.g. providing an URL for an
        actor to a Wikipedia entry is already possible. Other features e.g. linking to
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikidata.org">Wikidata</a> will be implemented.
    </p>
    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-4">File Upload</h4>
    <p>
        Files can be uploaded and linked with entities. It is possible to link one file to multiple
        entities (e.g. a group picture showing different actors) and the other way round. Files are available
        to download in the original size. In the admin interface the upload file size limit and
        allowed extensions can be configured.
    </p>
    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-4">Network Visualization</h4>
    <p>
        Due to the integration of <a target="_blank" href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, it is possible
        to visualize data as a network graph in 2D and 3D.
    </p>
    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-4">Spatial and Temporal Fuzziness</h4>
    <p>
        In many cases the spatial or temporal position respectively extent of an entity is not known
        precisely. Therefore, OpenAtlas allows to define time-spans (earliest/latest begin and
        earliest/latest end) or areas in which the temporal respectively spatial extent can be
        located with a 100% certainty.
    </p>
    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-4">Archaeological Subunits</h4>
    <p>
        These allow detailed mapping of archaeological finds, e.g. in a cemetery. They are used in a strict
        hierarchy: Place -> Feature (e.g. a grave) -> Stratigraphic Unit (e.g. a coffin or skeleton)
        -> Find (e.g. grave goods) and Human Remains (e.g. for anthropological information on the burial).
    </p>
    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-4">Search and Filters</h4>
    <p>
        To allow quick navigation, even in a big data set, full-text search is possible.
        Additionally, a refined advanced search can be used to filter the results (e.g. only actors
        or a search in descriptions).
        Tables and tree views, that can have many entries, have a full-text filter for convenience.
        The map provides a search field for a GeoNames search.
    </p>
    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-4">API</h4>
    <p>
        An application programming interface (API) for easier exchange with other information system
        was implemented. In it's first version it is possible to request data from single entities.
        The output is based on <a target="_blank" href="https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/">JSON-LD syntax</a>
        and <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946">GeoJSON</a>.
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/LinkedPasts/linked-places">Linked Places</a> was used as standard.
        More features will follow in upcoming versions.
    </p>
    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-4">Export</h4>
    <p>
        A CSV export for single tables and a SQL export (pg_dump) are implemented in the admin
        interface.
    </p>
    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-4">Import</h4>
    <p>
        CSV lists can be imported, e.g. a list of places (name, description, dates and point
        coordinates).
    </p>
    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-4">Data integrity check functions</h4>
    <p>
        Because data integrity is important for the quality of research data, we implemented
        functions to check possible inconsistencies
        including checks for orphaned data, date inconsistency, duplicates, similar names, invalid
        links, unused types and more.
    </p>
    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-4">Users and Groups</h4>
    <p>
        Users and Groups are used to grant different access levels. If an email is configured, new users
        can receive an automated mail with access data and can request a password resets.
    </p>
    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-4">Internationalization</h4>
    <p>
        Multiple languages for the user interface are implemented with
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/">gettext</a>. At the moment
        English and German are available. Easy extention to other languages is possible, when translations available.
    </p>
    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-4">Newsletter</h4>
    <p>
        This feature enables managers and admins to send newsletters. An editable receiver list
        with users who have opted in is shown. Newsletters will contain an unsubscribe link.
    </p>
    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-4">Bookmarks and notes</h4>
    <p>
        Bookmarks and notes are user specific and can be used to e.g. mark entries which need further editing.
        Already bookmarked entities and notes are shown on the start page after login.
