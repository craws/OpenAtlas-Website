  <h4 class="mt-4 fw-bold fs-4">Mission Statement</h4>
  <hr>

  <h5 class="mt-5 fw-bold fs-5">Open</h5>
  <p>
    OpenAtlas puts great emphasis on being open source, open access and just
    open in general. The code is therefore released under a
    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html" target="_blank">GPLv2</a>
    license. You can find the OpenAtlas code on
    <a href="https://github.com/craws/OpenAtlas" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. In
    addition, for any (further) development of the system, only other open
    source applications and programs are used. Due to the emphasis put on open
    source and open access, cooperating projects are required to make their
    data available as open access to interested scientists and the
    public after the project has been completed.
  </p>

  <h5 class="mt-5 fw-bold fs-5">Transparent</h5>
  <p>
    OpenAtlas places great emphasis on transparency - in the development
    of the software as well as in the communication with project partners and
    the public.
    All documentation of the software is publicly accessible via the
    <a href="https://manual.openatlas.eu" target="_blank">manual</a> and
    the project's own <a href="https://redmine.openatlas.eu/projects/uni/wiki" target="_blank">wiki</a>. The <a href="https://redmine.openatlas.eu/projects/uni/issues" target="_blank">issue tracker</a> and the <a href="https://redmine.openatlas.eu/projects/uni/roadmap" target="_blank">roadmap</a> with planned new
    features are also freely accessible and editable via OpenAtlasâ€™ <a href="https://redmine.openatlas.eu/" target="_blank">Redmine</a>.
    Here you can also find <a href="https://redmine.openatlas.eu/projects/uni/wiki/Project_meetings" target="_blank">meeting minutes</a> for meetings with cooperating
    projects as well as for the regular team meetings.
    The <a href="https://demo.openatlas.eu/" target="_blank">demo</a> as well as the <a href="https://demo-dev.openatlas.eu/" target="_blank">developmental version of the demo</a> (with the latest
    developments of the database system) allow anyone to explore the software
    via common browsers.
    Furthermore, the project's own <a href="{{ url_for('about') }}">homepage</a> offers insight into the team,
    future and already held events as well as cooperating projects.
  </p>

  <h5 class="mt-5 fw-bold fs-5">High-Quality</h5>
  <p>
    OpenAtlas code is developed with the highest standards in mind. Therefore,
    coding standards such as <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/" target="_blank">PEP8</a>, <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/" target="_blank">HTML 5</a>, etc. are followed during the
    development of the software. In addition, quality assurance tools such as
    <a href="https://mypy-lang.org/" target="_blank">Mypy</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pylint/" target="_blank">Pylint</a> are used.
    It is also important that the software is always up-to-date.
    OpenAtlas also uses extensive testing strategies with high coverage during
    development to detect bugs early. If bugs appear in a production version
    after all, solving these have the highest priority.
    To ensure data quality, OpenAtlas uses <a href="https://www.cidoc-crm.org/" target="_blank">CIDOC CRM</a>. In the background of the
    application, compliance with the specific rules of the ontology is checked.
    Non-compliant data is not processed. Moreover, own data can be subjected to
    data integrity checks at any time to guarantee the highest quality.
  </p>

  <h5 class="mt-5 fw-bold fs-5">Interoperable</h5>
  <p>
    Furthermore, the use of the <a href="https://www.cidoc-crm.org/" target="_blank">CIDOC CRM</a> ontology also allows datasets to be recombined. It is one of the ways in which the
    <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank">FAIR</a>
    principles are taken into account in the project. To make the data further
    interoperable, OpenAtlas also provides its own API to interface with other
    applications and query the data stored in the database. Different output
    formats are possible. In addition, it is possible to download datasets
    directly from the user interface - as JSON, RDF, or CSV.
    External References allow the linking of own datasets with other
    vocabularies and gazetteers but also analog documents like inventory
    numbers of museums or card catalogs of libraries and thus create Linked
    Open Data.
    The long-term archiving of data is also taken into account through
    cooperation with <a href="https://arche.acdh.oeaw.ac.at" target="_blank">ARCHE</a>.
  </p>

  <h5 class="mt-5 fw-bold fs-5">Usable</h5>
  <p class="mb-5">Great importance is also placed on the usability of the software,
    especially in light of the fact that many <a href="{{ url_for('cooperation') }}">cooperation partners</a> come from
    the field of humanities and do not have the additional resources to deal
    with specific questions of software development in addition to their
    research focus. Furthermore, the performance of the application is also
    particularly important and is taken into consideration with every step, as
    it contributes significantly to enabling fluent working.
    OpenAtlas offers a multilingual user interface to accommodate researchers
    from different regions and to facilitate their work. In addition, it is
    configurable and highly flexible, through the use of types, particularly
    adaptable to specific research questions.
